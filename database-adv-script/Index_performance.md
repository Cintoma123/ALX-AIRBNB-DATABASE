# What You Need to Do

1. *Identify High-Usage Columns*
Look into your queries and pick columns in the `User`, `Booking`, and `Property` tables that you commonly:
- Use in `WHERE` filters (e.g., `user_id`, `start_date`, `property_id`)
- Use in `JOIN` conditions
- Sort using `ORDER BY`

2. *Write CREATE INDEX Statements*
In your `database_index.sql` file, write SQL commands like:

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);
```

This tells MySQL to create a shortcut for quickly accessing data on that column.

# Save all those statements in *`database_index.sql`*.

3. *Measure Performance*
Use `EXPLAIN` before and after creating the indexes on the same query to see improvements in how MySQL runs it.

#  Index Optimization Report

# Objective  
To improve query speed by creating indexes on frequently accessed columns in the `User`, `Booking`, and `Property` tables.

---

#  High-Usage Columns Identified
- `User.user_id`
- `Booking.user_id`, `Booking.property_id`, `Booking.start_date`
- `Property.property_id`

---

üõ†Ô∏è Indexes Created
Saved in `database_index.sql`:
- Index on `user_id` for both `User` and `Booking`
- Index on `property_id` in `Booking` and `Property`
- Index on `start_date` in `Booking`

---

üìä Performance Testing
Used `EXPLAIN` to measure query execution steps before and after indexing.  
‚úÖ Result: Queries executed faster, and full table scans were reduced.
